          <p>It hit me one day when I was sitting at my desk in a newspaper office, editing a story that I knew would very likely be lining a puppy's kennel by the end of the week.</p>

          <p>I wanted to create things that would have a lasting impact â€” something that people would revisit again and again for inspiration and information.</p>

          <p>The story I was editing claimed that coding was empowering people in all industries who felt disillusioned
          with their job's relevance.</p>

          <p>Since leaving my job in journalism to enter the world of web development, I haven't looked back, but I strive to apply the same conciseness and clarity to my code as I did to my writing.</p>
